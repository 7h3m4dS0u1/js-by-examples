# JavaScript by Examples

##### What is this?

Understand the nitty gritties of the language by actually looking at code snippets and asking the right (or wrong) questions - the whats, whys and hows. The repository is a collection of code samples containing the required explanations of working of the code sample.

##### Why this approach? 

First things first, this is not a replacement for conventional learning by books, blogs and countless experimentations. This is just an add-on to the exisiting set of learning paths. We realized, the best way to validate our understanding about the language is to discuss with fellow members, brainstorm and educate others.

##### How did we get here?

This is a result of the IM group chats within our team at work. We thought it might be helpful to the community as well, and hence this repository.

##### Is this content not already available online?

Yes and No. Perhaps the code snippets are all there already, or you may find a variation of these. However, the approach is unique as we have a Q&A format and a way of clarifying things through explanations given to the working of the snippets. The content and the code examples will have appropriate attributions wherever applicable. We would really appreciate an attibution from you, if you are using/including any of this repository code examples within your work. 

##### How can I help?

If you find (and believe) any information available here erroneous, please report them as issues or create pull requests. We are all ears for additional suggestions, feedback and new content as long as it follows the format that we are using.

##### What is the format?

Most of the code samples are either in `.md` or `.js` files. The markdown file format follows the question, answer and explanation format. If there are any usful references, links or attributions, we put them too.

##### What is the future plan?

We would like this repository to grow and be the one-stop-repo for all the JavaScript enthusiasts. For that, we would need all the help we can from the community and people like YOU. 

##### Who are the contributors?

This is the list of initial contributors, we will try to keep this updated as and when we recieve contributions from the community.
